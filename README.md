You need to run each Dataset folder in the following order:
save_permanent -> preprocess -> rm_outliers -> labelling -> analysis.

Only after all folders (except Dataset C) have run successfully can you run the analysis for the common dataset.
If you are unexpectedly logged out and need to log back in, you will need to repeat the above process.
